#Play Angular2 Typescript sample application [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joost-de-vries/play-angular2-typescript.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joost-de-vries/play-angular2-typescript)

This is an activator template that generates a sample Play Angular2 Typescript 1.8 application with a tutorial.

As mentioned it features an Angular2 application with Typescript compilation integrated with the continuous compilation of Play Scala code. The Typescript code is linted with `tslint`.

Once you have [activator](https://www.typesafe.com/community/core-tools/activator-and-sbt) installed you can run `activator new play-angular2-typescript` and you'll have a local application with a tutorial. Or you can just clone this repo and run `sbt ~run`.

Currently the tutorial is still being written.
