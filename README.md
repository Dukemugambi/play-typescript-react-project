#Play Angular2 Typescript sample application

This is an activator template that generates a sample Play Angular2 Typescript 1.8 application with a tutorial.

Once you have [activator](https://www.typesafe.com/community/core-tools/activator-and-sbt) installed you can run `activator new play-angular2-typescript` and you'll have a local application with a tutorial. Or you can just clone this repo and run `sbt ~run`.

Currently the tutorial is still being written.
